Gameboardto make the board of this tictactoe game, I used nested loops to make the board more realistic.

to update the board or to get the latest board, I used closure. Also factory functions so that i can use some of the methods, properties and closures globally.

Gamecontroller - this function will hold all the properties, methods and logic for the tictactoe game. I used detructuring to be able to extract the rows and use bracket methods and loops to extract the values of the columns.

ScreenController - this function will hold most of the screen functionallity or the UI, update the screen and etc..

There are many things to improve on this game I made such as keep track on the scores of each player and make a customize game like best of 3's, 4's , or 5's and so on. And also for computer vs human feature (select easy, medium, and hard).
